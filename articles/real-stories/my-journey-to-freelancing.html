                <h1>My journey to freelancing</h1>
                <img src="/assets/typing-on-keyboard.jpg" alt="">
                <p>You know that one thing you've been doing since you were a kid? The thing that you carried with you through your life and never let go of. Writing is that thing for me.</p>
                <p>It has always been my thing. From lame poetry and short stories in high school to digital communications at societies in university, and on to a career in content - I've been a writer through everything.</p>
                <p>After doing my undergrad degree in Media and Political Science, and my honours in Political Communication - I thought the clear path was journalism. But, as I'm sure you all know, sometimes experiences aren't what you expect them to be.</p>
                <p>Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed my internship writing news and commenting on current events, and I learned so much, but it felt like something was missing.</p>
                <p>I moved to B2B blog writing, and then to PR as a digital copywriter for tech businesses. Yet, something still felt amiss.</p>
                <p>It dawned on me recently that what's missing is helping, or feeling like I'm making a difference. Large corporations and big businesses,- as fun as they are to work for - don't need help getting their names out there. But small to medium local businesses do.</p>
                <p>Individuals who run smaller, local businesses are the ones who really need content marketing. They aren't already well known, they don't have massive teams backing them, and they often get overwhelmed with the stress of marketing, on top of running a business all on their own.</p>
                <p>By working with these businesses, it feels like I am working with real people who have a real stake in the success of their business. This is where I think my sweet spot is - the element that has been missing this whole time.</p>
                <p>With the experience I have gained in my studies and through my career, I can help local entrepreneurs get their foot in the door of the developing digital landscape in Africa. From there, their chance at success and gaining new clients will be promising to say the least.</p>
                <p>I'm excited to start this journey, and look forward to all the learning ahead!</p>If you find yourself in need of some content, whether it be social media copy, blog posts, articles, or newsletters, don't hesitate to get in contact with me at <a href="mailto:ilhaamcontentcreator@gmail.com">ilhaamcontentcreator@gmail.com</a>.
