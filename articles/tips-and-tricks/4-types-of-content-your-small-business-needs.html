                <h1>4 types of content your small business needs</h1>
                <img src="/assets/content.jpg" alt="laptop and notepad">
                <p>Small businesses often skimp on content, on the basis that it is too time-consuming and expensive. Yet, <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/content-marketing-statistics/" target="_blank">67% of marketers report</a> that content marketing generates demand/leads.</p>
                <p>It's been proven over and over that creating content is great for businesses big and small. Of course, the caveat is that you don't need content everywhere.</p>
                <p>For small businesses, the knowledge of where to post content is invaluable. The mixture of sites you may use will be different depending on your target market - but the types of content you post can remain relatively similar. </p>
                <p>Here are the types of content you should consider if you're running a small business</p>
                
                <h2>1. Qualifying content (e.g. Testimonials)</h2>
                <p>Whether you've had 1 client or 100 - testimonials are valuable. They show potential clients what you're capable of, the types of people you work with, and the value of your work overall. By posting testimonials, you can be certain your upcoming clients will know what they're getting.</p>
                <p>Ensure that you ask all your clients to give you some feedback (not all of them will agree to and that's okay). Get this feedback to a content writer, so that they can shape it into a well-worded client testimonial. </p>
                <p>These can be posted on all platforms</p>

                <h2>2. Outgoing content (e.g. Emails and newsletters)</h2>
                <p>Newsletters and emails are a great way to keep your potential and current client base up to date with your business. In these communications, you should talk about anything exciting happening in your space, sales, new products, and even simply educational information. </p>
                <p>It has been found that for every R17.96 (1 dollar) you spend on these types of communications, <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/email-marketing-statistics" target="_blank">the ROI is R718.30 (40 dollars)</a>. Definitely worth the extra effort!</p>
                <p>Consumers also report that receiving newsletters and emails can help build the relationship between them and the brand, and can increase trust. </p>

                <h2>3. On-page content (e.g. blogs and social media)</h2>
                <p>This is not necessarily there to generate leads - its main purpose is to build trust. </p>
                <p>The benefits of blogs include: 
                    Bettering your relationship with your target audience,
                    Improving website SEO,
                    Clarifying your brand tone and voice. 
                    </p>
                <p>On the other hand, social media can: 
                    Improve engagement, 
                    Connect you with your audience. 
                    </p>    
                <p>Both are important for brand building and brand building is a key to success! They provide value to people, without the expectation of a return (although there often IS a return).</p>

                <h2>4. Passive content (e.g. Web copy, tag lines, or your slogan)</h2>
                <p>Taglines are important because they gain consumers' attention. </p>
                <p>Your tagline gives consumers a clear indication of the benefits they will receive by using your services or product. It should be crafted to stand out and be unique as it helps differentiate your brand from others with similar products. </p>
                <p>In addition, taglines are used to reinforce a brand's core values and give your company an identity. Consumers learn what you stand for and can better decide if your company is one they can relate to and support when reading your tagline.</p>
                <p>Similarly, great slogans are memorable and convey positive feelings about a particular brand. Slogans improve campaigns for specific products, aiming to ensure high sales for the company. </p>

                <h2>Get going!</h2>
                <p>Now that you know what types of content you need, you should get creating as soon as you can to ensure you don't lose out!</p>
                <p>Writing all of this on your own can be difficult - if it's too large of a task, consider <a href="https://contentbyilhaam.co.za/articles/tips-and-tricks/how-to-brief-your-content-writer.html" target="_blank">hiring a content writer</a> to help you out</p>
