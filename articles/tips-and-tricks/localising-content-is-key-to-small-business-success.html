                <h1>Localising content is key to small business success</h1>
                <img src="/assets/pins-on-map.jpg" alt="">
                <p>These days, a small business can be global. The rise of the internet has allowed organisations to cultivate client bases across the seas.</p>
                <p>But, if you want this to become a reality for your company, you need your content marketing to be just right. The way to do this is through localised content.</p>

                <h2>What is localised content?</h2>
                <p>While translating content plays a role in localising, it's not the entirety of it.</p>
                <p>Localising is about making your content relatable to the people reading it. It's about adapting to the social conventions of the target market.</p>
                <p>For example, making use of local slang can create a sense of familiarity between you and the reader. Familiarity breeds trust and trust results in sales.</p>
                <p>It's all about connection.</p>

                <h2>4 Benefits of localising content</h2>
                <p>Research has found that a lack of content localisation can result in the loss of 8% - 13% of customers. Statistics also show that content that is locally targeted has six times more engagement than posts that were designed for the global market.</p>
                <p>Based on this, you can imagine that the benefits of localising content are major. Here are just a few of them:</p>

                <h3>1. Expanding your clientele</h3>
                <p>By making an effort to relate to people in areas other than your own, you can significantly increase the size of your client base. Since the internet broke down the borders and barriers already, you may as well take advantage of the opportunities you now have.</p>
                <p>Remeber, increased clients means increased sales.</p>

                <h3>2. Beating your competition</h3>
                <p>The fact is, not many people have the time and resources to localise their content. Finding ways to relate to people across the world takes a lot of research. This means that your competitors may not be doing it.</p>
                <p>In other words, if you localise your content, you could have a chance to stand out from the crowd. People - consumers in particular - like to see brands be authentic, they like to see real effort at connecting. Localisation will give you that edge.</p>

                <h3>3. Better your local SEO</h3>
                <p>Ensuring that your content is fine tuned for a specific audience results in better SEO for localised searches. If it seems like your content is perfect for a specific local audience, Google is more likely to serve up your website to searchers.</p>

                <h3>4. Improves credibility</h3>
                <p>Localising content means smoothly assimilating into the target market. Connecting directly with peoples experiences and feelings creates a strong marketing message that is likely to strike a chord. This increases your credibility.</p>

                <h2>Connect with the locals</h2>
                <p>Gaining a global customer base is worth the effort you'll have to put into localising your content. With increased trust, credibility, better SEO, and a competitive edge over your competitors, your ROI is sure to be outstanding.</p>
                <p>If you feel you don't have time to work on your blogs and do them justice, consider hiring a content writer to help you out!</p>
