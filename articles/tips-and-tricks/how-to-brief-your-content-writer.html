                <h1>How to brief your content writer</h1>
                <img src="/IlhaamBlog/assets/girl-with-laptop.jpg" alt="">
                <p>So you have a small business, your website is up and running, but your content is sparse. As a result, your site is probably not drawing in as much traffic as you'd like it to.</p>
                <p>This leads you to make the decision to hire a content writer. However, this is not something you've done before. Where to start?</p>
                <p>Well, once you've secured the freelance content writer you need to send them a content brief.</p>

                <h2>What to include in a content brief</h2>
                <p>A content brief is a detailed document that outlines exactly what you want from a writer. It gives them a solid starting post, allowing them to deliver precisely the content that you need. You should include all of the below:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Topic</h3>
                            <p>In most cases, you'd probably know what you want your blogs to be about. If that is true, add the specific topic you have in mind.</p>
                            <p>If you don't have an exact idea of a topic but have a generally preferred subject, that is perfectly fine too. Note it down, add some examples, and let the writer know they have the freedom to choose the direction of the piece.</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Length</h3>
                            <p>Digital content should be between 500 - 800 words. However, long-form content does have its space and purpose online. Make sure to give a ballpark figure of the number of words you'd like the blog or article to be</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Keywords</h3>
                            <p>Google and other search engines use keywords to identify what your post is about. It helps them to order search results. You can think of a keyword or a keyphrase as the sentence that your ideal customer would type into Google to find you.</p>
                            <p>For example, if you're a baker in Cape Town a useful keyphrase might be “bakeries in Cape Town”.</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Tone/Brand voice</h3>
                            <p>The tone and voice of your posts will indicate to the end reader what your brand's personality is. You should give some thought to what you want that to be. A conversational tone is most commonly used. Remember, if you go for a conversational tone, you might not stand out from your competitors.</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Results/outcomes</h3>
                            <p>What is the purpose of your content? Do you want it to convert readers to customers? Do you want to increase traffic to your site? Let the writer know. But, ensure that you're offering reachable, tangible goals. For example, “an increase in traffic by 5%”.</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Target market</h3>
                            <p>Your target market is the group of people you envision buying your product or using your service. It's important for the writer to know who they are speaking to.</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Links</h3>
                            <p>You can add any links that you think may assist the reader. This could include links to your existing blogs for them to get a grasp of your tone and voice. It could also be examples of what you want the content to be like or case studies and research that you want to be included in the post.</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Competition</h3>
                            <p>Talk about the companies or entrepreneurs you are up against. Add links to their websites and examples of their content. This shows the writer who they need to be better than, it shows them the content they are trying to beat.</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Structuring your content brief</h2>
                <p>The layout is important for content briefs, just as it is for most other documents.</p>
                <p>Once you have all the information outlined above, all you have to do is break it down section by section in a document.</p>
                <p>The information should be easy to comprehend at a glance. Highlight the most important points so that the writer can find any information that they're looking for, quickly.</p>
                <p>It could look something like this:</p>
                <p><b>Title suggestion: </b>(insert your preferred title here)</p>
                <p><b>Word count: </b>(add the number of words you'd like the article or blog to be)</p>
                <p><b>Audience: </b>(describe the personas of the people you'd like to be reading your content)</p>
                <p><b>Keywords: </b> (suggest at least one keyword for the writer to focus on)</p>

                <h2>Get ready for your content</h2>
                <p>With your brief in their artillery, your content writer should be set up for success. They have all the information they need to give you exactly what you want.</p>
                <p>Now, all you have to do is sit back and wait for your blogs or articles to be delivered. Soon enough, your website will be populated with informative, educational, and convincing content.</p>
