                <h1>Why your small business needs a blog</h1>
                <img src="/assets/typing-on-keyboard.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Your small business is finally up and running! Congratulations! The hard work you put in to have everything in order is paying off right in front of your eyes.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, the work never stops. You now have to find ways to gain clients, build relationships with your customers, and advertise. Blogging is a great way to do all of this in one place.</p>

                <h2>6 Reasons to blog for your small business</h2>
                <p>Blogging may sound vapid - like a huge task with not a lot of payoff. But that couldn't be further from the truth. Using this medium of communication has proven to have several benefits, especially for small businesses.</p>
                <p>SEM Rush found that 46% of people take recommendations from blogs, and 84% of companies have a content marketing strategy. Your small business should be part of that 84%, Here's why:</p>

                <h4>1. Your website</h4>
                <p>Blogging does a lot for your website. Not only does it draw in more traffic by improving your website's ranking in search results. It also makes the site more interesting, keeping people on your page for longer.</p>
                
                <h4>2. Your brand</h4>
                <p>Building your brand's voice, tone, and personality is a must. A factor that drives customers to make purchases is relatability - people often connect pieces of their personality to the values of a business, leading them to support the organisation.</p>
                <p>Your blog offers you an opportunity to build out a character for your brand. Keep your target market and ideal customer in mind when creating your content, and you'll see how your engagement increases.</p>

                <h4>3. Your expertise</h4>
                <p>If you create thoughtful, interesting content, your blog could turn you into an industry thought leader. You can show off your expertise, educate people, and from there build consumer trust in your skills, products, or services.</p>

                <h4>4. Your sales</h4>
                <p>Blogs can be a space to convince people why your product is going to improve their lives. It is one of the methods marketers use to nurture leads into real customers. In fact, 57% of marketers say they've gained customers specifically through blogging.</p>

                <h4>5. Your social media</h4>
                <p>Remember that content is king. And, you have to have content in more than just one place to keep people's attention - you must be available across platforms.</p>
                <p>Blogging can help you keep up with your social media content, as the blog content can be repurposed. This way, you don't have to always create new social content - saving you time in the long run.</p>

                <h4>6. Your customer relationships</h4>
                <p>A blog opens up a space for conversations to happen, and gives people something to talk about. You can connect with your readers to build a relationship of trust between the brand and the consumer.</p>

                <h2>Get blogging</h2>
                <p>Don't lose out on all the benefits that blogging can bring your business. Get started today. And, if you feel you're not the blogging type, consider hiring a freelancer to help you get going.</p>
